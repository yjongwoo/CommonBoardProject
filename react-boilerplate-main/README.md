# React Boilerplate

## Specs

- React
- Vite
- Jest + Chance (Sadly, Faker is no longer available ðŸ˜ž)
- Prettier + Husky

## Dependencies Setup

- Optimized for Yarn
- Supports offline install

### How to Disable Offline Mode

- Remove ./.yarnrc
- Remove ./npm_packages
- Remove `reset` script from ./package.json
- Add `^` to all package versions(or other semver annotations)
- Reinstall all npm packages using `yarn install`

## Starting Guide

- Local server proxy is set up by Vite. Refer to `service_backend` in ./vite.config.js as an example.
- Environment variables can be injected using .env files and `replace` plugin in ./vite.config.js.
- Static files can be served locally by Vite by placing them under ./public directory. These files are copied to ./dist directory along with others as part of production build result.

### For Dependency Package Developments

Add the following package.json scripts if this package is meant to be used as a npm dependency of some other project.

```json
{"prepublishOnly": "pinst --disable",
"postpublish": "pinst --enable"}
```

## Build

- `vite dev` assumes Vite `MODE=dev`
- `vite build` assumes Vite `MODE=production`, `NODE_ENV=production`
- Run `yarn build` with `--mode [dev/production]` for specific build

##### Note

- Production preview server runs on port 8000 instead of 5000 due to Apple Airplay [issue](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682332). Remove or change port option in `serve` script in ./package.json if needed.
- `pinst` package lets you have postinstall hook that runs only in dev. This can be useful if you want to automatically run commands just after npm install, but don't want your package users to be affected. Remove if not necessary (ex: stand-alone app).
